# --- Social Network ---
# Dunbar's Number research: meaningful connections ~15-20, casual ~150
max_connections=15         # Reduced: reflects strong-tie networks

# Sunstein (2001) Echo Chambers & Homophily research:
same_school_weight=0.6     # Schools create strong ideological clustering
same_religious_weight=0.5  # Religious communities are high-trust, high-influence
same_workplace_weight=0.35 # Workplace weaker: more diverse, less personal
same_town_weight=0.15      # Geographic proximity less relevant in modern era
age_group_weight=0.4       # Generational cohorts strongly influence each other
ethnicity_weight=0.3       # In-group bias is significant per social identity theory
homophily_strength=1.5     # Stronger echo chambers: like attracts like (Centola, 2010)

# --- SEDPNR State Transitions ---
# Based on epidemiological models of rumor spread (Daley-Kendall model)
# and psychological research on belief persistence (Lewandowsky, 2012)
prob_s_to_e=0.08           # Lower: not everyone exposed pays attention
prob_e_to_d=0.25           # Higher: exposed people quickly form opinions
prob_d_to_p=0.15           # Lower: fewer become active spreaders (1% rule of internet)
prob_d_to_n=0.20           # Higher: many believe but don't actively share
prob_d_to_r=0.08           # Higher: skeptics/fact-checkers reject during doubt phase
prob_p_to_n=0.06           # Spreaders tire out and go silent

prob_n_to_r=0.03           # Passive believers rarely fully recover

# --- Claim Mechanics ---
# Vosoughi et al. (2018): Falsehood spreads 6x faster, reaches people 6x faster
# Also: Falsehood is 70% more likely to be retweeted than truth
misinfo_multiplier=6.0     # Maintain: strongly supported by MIT study
truth_threshold=0.7        # Higher: truth requires more cognitive effort to verify
misinfo_threshold=0.3      # Lower: misinfo exploits emotional shortcuts (easier to believe)
